# ü§ñ Robot Mapping and Object Tracking

## üó∫Ô∏è Main Project: Room Mapping Robot
The goal of this project is to develop a robot capable of mapping an entire room. The generated map will then be uploaded to a database, allowing other users to download and utilize it for their own robots.

### Hardware in Use:
- **Waveshare UGV02** - Unmanned Ground Vehicle
- **Raspberry Pi 5** + Active Cooler
  - Ubuntu Noble 24.04
- **Intel RealSense D415 Camera**
- **A2M8 - R4 LiDAR Sensor**

You can explore the code for this project [here](https://github.com/Spodymun/ros2-lidar-explorer).

## üéØ Side Project: Object Tracking and Pursuit
Additionally, the robot should be capable of tracking and pursuing a specific object within the mapped area. This feature builds on the mapping system to enhance interaction with objects in the environment.

### Hardware in Use:
- **Waveshare UGV02** - Unmanned Ground Vehicle
- **Raspberry Pi 5** + Active Cooler
  - Ubuntu Noble 24.04
- **Intel RealSense D415 Camera**

### Base Code (Verified as of 01.02.2025):
- **Intel RealSense**: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/jupyter/notebooks/distance_to_object.ipynb)
  
### Object Detection Model: MobileNetSSD (Verified as of 01.02.2025)
- **Model Files**:
  - `deploy.prototxt`: MobileNetSSD architecture
  - `mobilenet_iter_73000.caffemodel`: Pre-trained weights

You can download the model files from [MobileNet-SSD GitHub](https://github.com/chuanqi305/MobileNet-SSD).

### PyRealSense2 Setup for Raspberry Pi 5 (Verified as of 01.02.2025)
While Intel does not provide an official method for setting up the **PyRealSense2** library on Raspberry Pi 5, the following guide has been tested and verified:
- [Setup Guide](https://www.robotexchange.io/t/how-to-setup-the-intel-realsense-software-and-pyrealsense2-library-in-ubuntu-on-a-raspberryi-pi-5/3414)

### Install Dependencies
I didn‚Äôt have any issues installing **PyRealSense2** using the guide I published.  
Nevertheless, I‚Äôve already installed all the dependencies from my [Lidar Project](https://github.com/Spodymun/ros2-lidar-explorer).
